## Meeting: Product Planning Q1 2024

**Date:** January 15, 2024  
**Attendees:** Sarah (Product Manager), Mike (Engineering Lead), Lisa (Designer), Tom (Marketing)

### Discussion Points

**Sarah:** Good morning everyone. Let's start with our Q1 planning session. We need to finalize our roadmap for the next quarter.

**Mike:** I've reviewed the technical requirements for the new user dashboard. We'll need about 6 weeks to implement the core functionality, including the analytics integration.

**Lisa:** From a design perspective, I've completed the wireframes. The user testing sessions showed positive feedback, but we need to simplify the navigation. I recommend we focus on the top 3 user workflows first.

**Tom:** Marketing-wise, we're planning a launch campaign for March. We need the beta version ready by February 15th to allow time for user feedback and final adjustments.

### Key Deliverables

**Sarah:** Great. So our key deliverables are:

1. Complete user dashboard development by February 28th
2. Finalize design iterations based on user testing by February 10th
3. Beta release by February 15th
4. Marketing campaign launch in March

### Concerns and Solutions

**Mike:** One concern - the analytics integration might be complex. We should consider a phased approach. Phase 1 with basic metrics, Phase 2 with advanced analytics.

**Lisa:** That makes sense. We can design the interface to accommodate both phases.

**Tom:** I'll coordinate with the content team to prepare marketing materials. We'll need product screenshots by February 20th.

### Action Items

**Sarah:** Action items:

- **Mike:** Create technical specification document by January 22nd
- **Lisa:** Deliver final designs by February 10th
- **Tom:** Prepare marketing timeline by January 25th
- **Sarah:** Schedule weekly check-ins starting next Monday

**Meeting adjourned at 10:45 AM.**
